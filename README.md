# NoteGenie - The genie of notes!

This is a smart solution to conventional notes, this app targets the lectures, short sentences and prepares the summary, features and anything that user wants to do with the note.

## Main Features

This app has a free version which uses deepspeech (Mozilla) for transcribtion and llama (Meta) model as a language model both are open source. But these both have lower accuracy but they work just fine to get the user what they need.
For higher accuracy we are using deepgram api for speech to text and openAi- Gpt-3.5 as a language model both are very fine tuned and are very accurate, these features will only be available in the in-app-purchases.

Main Features include:

- Recording of Audio and Importing of Audio and then transcribing them.
- Using language model on transcribed text and generating multiple prompts as the user asks for.
- NoteGenie can push notification and can push it 6 hours before the scheduled event.
- This has two section: 1- Genie Notes, 2- Atomic Goals: Kind of derived from atomic habits book.

This app is still in progess and this repo will be updated continuously.
